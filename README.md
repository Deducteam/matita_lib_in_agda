# Matita's arithmetic library in Agda

This repository contains a translation of Matita's arithmetic library in Agda, made using the tool [Predicativize](https://github.com/Deducteam/predicativize) and the logical framework Dedukti. We refer to the paper [Sharing proofs with predicative theories through universe polymorphic elaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15465) for an introduction to the tool and details about the translation.

[Matita's arithmetic library](https://github.com/LPCIC/matita/tree/master/matita/matita/lib/arithmetics) had first been [translated to Dedukti](https://github.com/Deducteam/Deducteam.github.io/blob/master/data/libraries/matita.tar.gz) by Ali Assaf, using the tool [Krajono](https://github.com/Deducteam/Krajono). Details about the translation from Matita to Dedukti can be found in [Ali's PhD thesis](https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01235303v4).
